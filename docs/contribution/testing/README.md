# Testing

Properly setting up your test environment and writing tests when contributing to FinCommerce core are essential parts of our development pipeline. The links below are also included in our [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce/blob/trunk/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) on GitHub.

If you have any questions about testing please reach out to the developer community in our public channels([Developer Blog](https://developer.fincommerce.com/blog/), [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce/discussions), or [Community Slack](https://fincommerce.com/community-slack/)).

## Unit Testing

[End-to-end tests](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/fincommerce/tests/e2e-pw) are powered by `Playwright`. The test site is spun up using `wp-env` ([recommended](https://developer.finpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/)). 

## API Testing

[API tests](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce/tree/trunk/plugins/fincommerce/tests/e2e-pw/tests/api-tests) are based on `Playwright` and `wp-env`.

## Calls for Testing

Keep tabs on calls for testing on our developer blog, and make sure to read our beta testing instructions to help us build new features and enhancements.
