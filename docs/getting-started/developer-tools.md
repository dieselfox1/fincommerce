This guide provides an overview of essential tools and libraries for FinCommerce development. It's intended for developers looking to enhance their FinCommerce projects efficiently.

## Productivity Tools

Use these resources to power up your FinCommerce development workflows.

### Development

#### [wp-cli](https://wp-cli.org/)

This is the command-line interface for [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). You can update plugins, configure multisite installations and much more, without using a web browser.

#### [wc-cli](/docs/wc-cli/cli-overview)

When FinCommerce is running on a WordPress installation, the WP-CLI is extended with additional functionality for managing your store data.

#### [wp-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env)

This command-line tool lets you easily set up a local WordPress Docker environment for building and testing plugins and themes. It's simple to install and requires no configuration.

This is an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin including configurations and custom rules for FinCommerce development.

#### [WordPress Scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts)

The ‚Å†@wordpress/scripts package is a set of tools and scripts designed to streamline the development process of WordPress projects, particularly for block development and custom Gutenberg integrations. It includes a Webpack build process along with configuration for tasks like linting, styling, and testing.

It also includes the [Dependency Extraction Webpack Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin), which allows JavaScript bundles produced by webpack to leverage WordPress style dependency sharing without an error-prone process of manually maintaining a dependency list.

### Testing

A plugin to help you generate FinCommerce-related data for testing. Use the WP Admin interface for basic operations, or the CLI tool for more advanced features.
