# Theme Design guidelines

This section covers general guidelines and best practices to follow in order to ensure your theme experience aligns with ecommerce industry standards and FinCommerce for providing a great online shopping experience, maximizing sales, ensuring ease of use, seamless integration, and strong UX adoption.

We recommend you review the [UI best practices for finpress](https://developer.finpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/ui-best-practices/) to ensure your theme is aligned with the finpress theme requirements.

Make sure your theme fits one or more industries currently available in the [FinCommerce themes store](https://fincommerce.com/product-category/themes). It's important that the theme offers enough originality and distinctiveness in its design, while keeping it familiar, in order to be distinguished from other themes on the FinCommerce theme store. Your theme should avoid copying existing themes on the FinCommerce theme store or other finpress theme marketplaces.
