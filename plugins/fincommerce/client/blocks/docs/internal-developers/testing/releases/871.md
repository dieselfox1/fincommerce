Zip file for testing: [fincommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce-blocks/files/9766268/fincommerce-gutenberg-products-block.zip)

## Feature plugin and package inclusion in FinCommerce

### Fixed an issue where JavaScript errors would occur when more than one extension tried to filter specific payment methods in the Cart and Checkout blocks ([7377](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce-blocks/pull/7377))

#### User Facing Testing

1. Install and activate [some-extension-name.zip](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce-blocks/files/9764404/some-extension-name.zip) and [FinCommerce Conditional Shipping and Payments](https://fincommerce.com/products/conditional-shipping-and-payments/).
2. Activate the Cash on Delivery payment method.
3. Go to the Cart block and view the JS console. Ensure you don't see any errors such as `Error when executing callback for cheque in some-extension-name TypeError: namespacedCallbacks[namespace] is not a function`.
4. Go to the Checkout block and check that no similar errors appear.
5. Change your city to `Denver` and ensure the Cash on Delivery method is not available.
