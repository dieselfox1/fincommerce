### Bug Fixes

#### Update Jetpack FinCommerce Analytics module integration to check for changed template names ([#11707](https://github.com/dieselfox1/fincommerce-blocks/pull/11707))

1. Enable Jetpack and ensure the FinCommerce Analytics module is set up and enabled.
2. Install [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/).
3. Go to the Cart and Checkout blocks and ensure no PHP warnings are logged.
